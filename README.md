## About

`cluedo.js` implements the well known board game in JavaScript. This version plays in ancient Greece where Socrates,
a true champion of the open society, has been murdered by one of his enemies. Dying, Socrates exclaimed:

*Crito, we owe a rooster to Asclepius. Please, don't forget to pay the debt!*
