## About

`cluedo.js` implements the well known board game in JavaScript. This version plays in ancient Greece where Socrates,
a true champion of the open society, has been murdered by one of his enemies.

## Playing

Download a [release](https://github.com/dirmeier/cluedo.js/releases) and open `index.html`. No installation of dependencies required.

## TODO

- landing page with dynamic setting of `nPlayers`
- use images for places/room
- generally improve UI and use my conventional CSS
- clean up/lint/check JS
- convert to Typescript
- add codacy
- implement bots to be able to play alone (i.e., RL/NN)
